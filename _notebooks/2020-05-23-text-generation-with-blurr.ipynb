UPDATED:. 06:13 EST, 30 December 2013. A new national register will log every breast implant operation in England to prevent a repeat of the scandal in which thousands of women received faulty implants, ministers have said. Tough marketing controls will also be introduced in the new year, with a ban on offering breast implants as competition prizes, time-limited offers, and so-called ‘mother and daughter deals’ for multiple patients. The Government has accepted most recommendations made in a review by Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, after the  disclosure that French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) made implants from industrial silicone. Nearly 50,000 women were affected after having faulty breast implants inserted, with many having them removed again as they ruptured more frequently (pictured) Almost 50,000 women in the UK and some 400,000 worldwide were affected by the scandal, which came to light two years ago when doctors found many implants were rupturing. Poor record-keeping by some private clinics meant that often women were unable to find out if they had the faulty implants. In future the implant a woman is given will be recorded in the new register, in the way hip and knee operations are already logged. Training will be improved, with the Royal College of Surgeons establishing new standards for cosmetic surgery. Surgeons will be required to have professional indemnity to protect clients. Ministers are expected to announce that the registry will be piloted from next month, and formalised later in 2014. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: 'For too long, the cosmetics industry has been completely unregulated and there are too many tales of women who have been exploited and of lives ruined by rogue cosmetic firms and practitioners. Tough marketing controls will also be introduced in the new year, with a ban on offering breast implants as competition prizes, time-limited offers, and so-called'mother and daughter deals' for multiple patients. 'This has to change, so we are taking robust action to clamp down on the cosmetic cowboys in order to properly protect women and the public. 'For the first time, there will be proper training courses for cosmetic surgeons, and we shall be setting up a breast implant registry which will better track the quality of implants and, if required, enable us to act much more quickly to protect women</td>\n",

The two sections were scheduled to be delivered to the roof deck, as long as weather allowed on Monday. Once they are installed, they will make the building the tallest in the Western Hemisphere, according to the site's management. The two pieces form a stainless steel beacon weighing almost six tons and will be the final piece put in place to give the building an iconic height of 1,776 feet, according to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Once the architectural structure is complete, it will be comprised of 18 separate sections of steel and three communication rings. The first -- and heaviest -- steel section was installed in January, weighing more than 67 tons, the news release said. Port Authority Assistant Director of Media Anthony Hayes said the original design included a radome -- short for radar dome -- but that was rejected because of anticipated servicing and maintenance difficulties. The radome would not have impacted the height, but would have provided an additional design element, which ultimately proved impractical, Hayes told CNN. The spire will serve a television broadcast facility housed in One World Trade Center, the press release said. While under construction, One World Trade Center became New York City's tallest building a year ago, standing 1,271 feet above street-level. The building then was 21 feet higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck.</td>\n",

              "      <td>By. Alexandra Klausner. Millennials may not be getting jobs because they value their smart phone more than they value things like personal hygiene and body odor. In data released on Monday by the Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility report, 1,000 adults were interviewed about how they value objects in their everyday lives. Only 87 per cent said that deodorant was important to them compared to 93 per cent who said that a smartphone was important. Millennials may bot be getting jobs because their smart phones than they acre about wearing deodorant. 91 per cent said that toothbrushes were important. Older adults cited deodorant and smartphones as equal in their everyday lives with the toothbrush ranking the highest importance at 95 per cent. NBC interviewed Susan RoaAne, the author of How to Work a Room, a book that gives workforce hopefuls advice on how to land a job. 'If people can smell you before they see you, you aren't getting the job,' said RoAne. Employees who let their personal hygiene slip after getting hired are also less likely to get promoted or get hired in a position that requires face to face contact with clients or CEOS. To make things even more difficult for recent graduates, unemployment in the workforce is high. The number of youths in the work force continues to drop and it may be because they don't wear deodorant or don't want to work. Older adults said that they cared about wearing deodorant just as much as they cared about using their smart phone. Data from May claims that unemployment among 25 to 34 year olds was 6.7 per cent. Unemployment went up a bit from April where it slightly lower at 6.6 per cent. Unemployment for those aged 20-24 is 11.1 per cent which is up from 10.6 per cent. Unemployment for all adults aged 20 and older is 5.8 per cent. Even though deodorant may keep the younger generation from entering the workforce, some evidence suggests that  millennials don't even really want jobs. Steve Toback, the managing partner of Invisor Consulting, told NBC that millennials have their own version of entrepreneurship where they don't even need to leave their 'parents basement.' 'What entrepreneurialism is for many of them is hanging out in their parents' basement or their childhood bedroom with their smartphone, calling themselves the CEO of this one-person company,' said Tobak. 'It's sad, but you don't need personal hygiene when you're the only person in the business.' Toback says that</td>\n",

The ISIS militant group has taken over small villages in Nineveh province, close to the Kurdistan region, but Irbil is still relatively safe. The explosion near the governor's office in the heart of the KRG capital is significant because the Kurdish region has had a history of stability, even during the sectarian battles between Sunnis and Shiites between 2005 and 2007.</td>\n",

        "The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,050 even before the Air Asia plane vanished. Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people, while an Air Algerie crash in Mali killed 116 and TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan killed a further 49 people. The remaining 456 fatalities were largely in incidents involving small commercial planes or private aircraft operating on behalf of companies, governments or organisations. Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - totalling just 111 across the whole world over the past 12 months. The all-time deadliest year for aviation was 1972 when a staggering 2,429 people were killed in a total of 55 plane crashes - including the crash of Aeroflot Flight 217, which killed 174 people in Russia, and Convair 990 Coronado, which claimed 155 lives in Spain. However this year's total death count of 1,212, including those presumed dead on board the missing Air Asia flight, marks a significant rise on the very low 265 fatalities in 2013 - which led to it being named the safest year in aviation since the end of the Second World War. Scroll down for videos. Deadly: The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,158 even before the Air Asia plane (pictured) vanished. Fatal: Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine (pictured) and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people. Surprising: Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949. 2014 has been a horrific year for Malaysia-based airlines, with 537 people dying on Malaysia Airlines planes, and a further 162 people missing and feared dead in this week's Air Asia incident. In total more than half the people killed in aviation incidents this year had been flying on board Malaysia-registered planes. In January a total of 12 people lost their lives in five separate incidents, while the same number of crashes in February killed 107. \n",
