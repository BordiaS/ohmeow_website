Hey there! Wayde here.  

I'm the owner of [ohmeow.com](https://ohmeow.com) and have been engaged in the development of mid-to-enterprise level application development for over 20 years.  An active member in the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) community and contributor to their deep learning framework, you can usually find me on their forums and/or tweeting about the latest and greatest from the world of AI.  I also have the privilege to mentor a number of High School students on a local FIRST Robotics FRC team (go team 2102!). 

I'm not one for most social media (honestly, most of it's nonsense and a net negative to our species), however, you can find me on twitter where my account is primarily professional in nature or via e-mail.  If you want to talk shop or see where we can help your organization, we'd love to hear from you!
